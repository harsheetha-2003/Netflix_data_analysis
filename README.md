# Netflix_data_analysis
I have done  data analysis on Netflix data. I explored the relationships between genre, IMDB scores, language, and movies. With this data, I was able to determine what kind of movies people prefer, how they rate movies, and which languages are most popular. It turns out that genre plays a big role in movie preferences. ðŸ˜€
